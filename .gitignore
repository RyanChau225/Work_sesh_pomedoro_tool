# Log files (if you want to keep them local and not in repo)
# work_logs.csv
# If you decide work_logs.csv should be in the repo, comment out or remove the line above.
# For now, I'll assume you might want to track it if it's user-generated content for a single-user app,
# but often logs are ignored. Let's keep it un-ignored by default for now.
